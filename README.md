# **EpicChain WalletConnect SDK**
Welcome to the **EpicChain WalletConnect SDK**! This toolkit is your gateway to integrating the EpicChain blockchain with various wallet providers seamlessly. With WalletConnect, users can securely interact with your decentralized applications (dApps) using their mobile wallets, providing a simple, user-friendly experience while interacting with the EpicChain ecosystem.

---

## **üîê Introduction**

The **WalletConnect SDK** is a powerful tool designed to allow seamless communication between decentralized apps (dApps) and mobile wallets in the EpicChain ecosystem. Whether you are building DeFi protocols, games, or NFT platforms, this SDK will enable users to sign transactions and messages securely from their preferred wallet, directly from their mobile device.

WalletConnect is an open-source protocol that connects wallets and dApps through a secure, peer-to-peer connection. By using the SDK, EpicChain developers can ensure that their users have a smooth, safe, and intuitive experience when interacting with their blockchain-based applications.

## **üöÄ Getting Started**

To get started with the **WalletConnect SDK** for EpicChain, follow these steps:

1. **Create an EpicChain Wallet**: Ensure you have an EpicChain wallet, as this will be needed for user interactions.
2. **Install Dependencies**: Before using this SDK, ensure your project has all the necessary dependencies installed.
3. **Integrate WalletConnect**: Use the provided classes and methods to integrate WalletConnect into your dApp or platform.

## **üõ† Installation**

To install the SDK into your project, follow the steps below:

### **1. Install via npm/yarn**
You can install the SDK through npm or yarn:

```bash
npm install @epic-chain/walletconnect-sdk
```
or
```bash
yarn add @epic-chain/walletconnect-sdk
```

### **2. Include the SDK in Your Project**
Once installed, import the SDK into your codebase:

```javascript
import WalletConnect from '@epic-chain/walletconnect-sdk';
```

---

## **‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Configuration**

After installation, you‚Äôll need to configure the SDK to connect to the EpicChain network. This involves setting up the `walletConnect` object with the necessary parameters.

```javascript
const walletConnect = new WalletConnect({
  bridge: "https://bridge.walletconnect.org",  // WalletConnect Bridge URL
  chainId: 1,  // EpicChain Network ID
  rpc: {
    1: "https://rpc.epic-chain.org",  // RPC URL for EpicChain
  },
});

if (!walletConnect.connected) {
  await walletConnect.connect();
}
```

In this example, we set the bridge URL and RPC provider for EpicChain. Be sure to update the `rpc` field to the EpicChain RPC URL, which ensures the SDK communicates with the EpicChain blockchain.

## **üìú API Reference**

Below are the key functions and properties available in the **WalletConnect SDK** for EpicChain:

### **1. WalletConnect()**
Constructor to instantiate a new WalletConnect object.

```javascript
const walletConnect = new WalletConnect({
  bridge: "https://bridge.walletconnect.org",
  chainId: 1,
  rpc: {
    1: "https://rpc.epic-chain.org",
  },
});
```

### **2. .connect()**
Initiates a connection between the dApp and the wallet.

```javascript
await walletConnect.connect();
```

### **3. .disconnect()**
Disconnects the user‚Äôs wallet from the dApp.

```javascript
walletConnect.disconnect();
```

### **4. .sendTransaction()**
Used to send a transaction through the connected wallet.

```javascript
const tx = {
  to: "0xAddress",
  data: "0xData",
  gas: 21000,
  gasPrice: "20000000000",
  value: "1000000000000000000",
};
await walletConnect.sendTransaction(tx);
```

### **5. .signMessage()**
Signs a custom message with the user‚Äôs wallet.

```javascript
const message = "Sign this message for authentication";
await walletConnect.signMessage(message);
```

---

## **‚ö° Security Considerations**

### **1. Always Use HTTPS**
Make sure to always use HTTPS endpoints to avoid man-in-the-middle attacks when connecting to wallets or APIs.

### **2. Never Share Private Keys**
Never store or share private keys in your application. Always rely on the connected wallet for signing transactions and messages.

### **3. Secure WalletConnect Sessions**
Ensure that WalletConnect sessions are properly secured with an appropriate session timeout and that users are notified when their session ends or becomes invalid.

## **üí° Use Cases**

The **WalletConnect SDK** for EpicChain is designed for a variety of use cases within the EpicChain ecosystem:

- **DeFi**: Integrate decentralized finance (DeFi) applications for users to interact with liquidity pools, staking, and yield farming.
- **NFTs**: Allow users to sign transactions when buying, selling, or minting non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on EpicChain.
- **Games**: Enable in-game wallet interactions such as signing in-game purchases, earning rewards, and connecting to decentralized gaming networks.
- **dApps**: Build decentralized applications that interact with the EpicChain blockchain and allow users to send transactions directly from their mobile wallets.

---

## **üí° Example Usage**

Here‚Äôs a simple example to show how you can integrate WalletConnect into your dApp:

```javascript
import WalletConnect from '@epic-chain/walletconnect-sdk';

// Create a WalletConnect instance
const walletConnect = new WalletConnect({
  bridge: "https://bridge.walletconnect.org",
  chainId: 1,
  rpc: {
    1: "https://rpc.epic-chain.org",
  },
});

// Connect to wallet
if (!walletConnect.connected) {
  await walletConnect.connect();
}

// Sign a transaction
const tx = {
  to: "0xReceiverAddress",
  data: "0xData",
  value: "1000000000000000000",
};
await walletConnect.sendTransaction(tx);
```

This code snippet allows users to connect their EpicChain wallet and send a transaction directly to the blockchain, all through WalletConnect.
